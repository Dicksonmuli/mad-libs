A mini project to practice java with spark

## Description
You're prompted to provide a specific number of nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. Then, they're inserted into a story that is missing those crucial words. The idea is to pick particularly odd or funny words without yet knowing what the story is. When you later fill them in, the results can be hilarious!

## Technologies
* java
* spark
* junit
